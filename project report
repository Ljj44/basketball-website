Design Choices
Visual Branding:
Color Scheme: Inspired by the energy and spirit of the sport, the website dons a vibrant orange and blue palette, reminiscent of a classic basketball.
Typography: Clear readability is paramount. Bold Oswald fonts for headings exude confidence, while Open Sans offers a clean and easy-to-read experience for body text.
User Experience:
Navigation: Effortless exploration awaits with a simple yet informative navigation bar at the top, providing quick access to all pages. Enjoy the added touch of interactive transitions as hover effects highlight your selected destination.
Page Layout: Consistency is key. Each page boasts a cohesive design with a structured header, footer, and dedicated space for the main content. Visual elements like tables and videos occupy the full width, maximizing their impact.

Responsiveness:
Mobile-First Approach: Recognizing the dominance of mobile devices, we implemented a flexible design. Flexbox and CSS media queries ensure that the content seamlessly adapts and rearranges for optimal viewing on any screen size, fostering a user-friendly experience across all platforms.
